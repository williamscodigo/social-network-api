# Social Network API ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

The Social Network API is a back-end application designed for social networking platforms. Built with MongoDB and Express.js, this API enables users to create accounts, share thoughts, react to other users' thoughts, and manage friend lists. It leverages the flexibility and scalability of MongoDB to handle large amounts of unstructured data, making it an ideal solution for modern social media applications.

This project provides the foundation for a robust social network, allowing developers to focus on building engaging front-end experiences while relying on this API for data management and operations.

## Features

- User Management

    - Create, update, and delete users with unique usernames and valid email addresses.

    - Automatically track and display the number of friends a user has with a virtual friendCount.

- Thought Sharing

    - Create, update, and delete thoughts with a character limit of 1â€“280 characters.

    - Associate thoughts with users and track reactions to each thought.

    - Automatically format timestamps for thoughts using getter methods.

- Reactions

    - Add and delete reactions (like comments) to thoughts.

    - Utilize nested documents for storing reactions within the thought model.

- Friendship Management

    - Add and remove friends from a user's friend list.

    - Use self-referencing relationships to manage friend connections.

- API Endpoints

    - Routes for managing users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships are organized for simplicity and efficiency.

    - Test all endpoints via Insomnia or Postman to ensure proper functionality.

- Data Relationships

    - Leverage Mongoose to manage data relationships between users, thoughts, and reactions.

    - Automatically delete associated thoughts when a user is removed (bonus feature).

- NoSQL Implementation

    - Built with MongoDB and Mongoose for seamless handling of large, unstructured datasets.

    - Includes advanced schema settings, such as virtuals for derived fields like reactionCount and friendCount.
